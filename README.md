# Hello World

This is my personal repository of everything I learned about git. It serves as a practice repository as I try new things using git with GitHub. It also contains contents about how to become better at using git version control system.

I have learned git VCS using BitBucket bit by bit during development processes on the go. What I want now is to extend my knowledge and learn everything from scratch so I won't miss any unturned stones along the way. I pretty much know the basics of git and I have a full understanding of the benefits of atomic commits with a good commit message. Now, I want to further expand my knowledge about the usage, tools, concepts and theories on using git with GitHub.
